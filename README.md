## Why build Bidon?

Header bidding hasn't conquered the world. **Ad mediations** are still in place, most of them have demand that can't
be disabled and could have priority against other demand partners that lead to less transparency, **unfair auctions**,
hidden fees and can cut Publisher's revenues. Also, almost all of the companies who run Ad Mediations have their own
publishing divisions that compete with their clients and have a huge unfair advantage of using all platform data & the
ability to buy any connected audience.

## Project Goals

To provide control over advertising auctions to Publishers, while making it fair and transparent. To allow **Publishers**:

-   Decide how to connect any type of the Demand partner, even multiple Ad Mediators
-   Ability to remove any Demand partner
-   Ability to A/B test different Demand partners, even Ad Mediators
-   To let market players and the community contribute to the solution, to add new partners, new integrations, and new
features which are demanded by the industry.
